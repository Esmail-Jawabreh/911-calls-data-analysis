## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of 911 emergency calls in Montgomery County, PA.  
The goal is to uncover temporal patterns, common incident reasons, busiest locations, and workload trends using Python data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ 911 Calls: Montgomery County, PA](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert)
